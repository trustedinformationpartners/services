## Role and Importance of the Signature Preservation Service

### 1. **Preservation of Electronic Signatures**
   - This service ensures the long-term validity and reliability of electronic signatures.
   - It safeguards the integrity, authenticity, and legal admissibility of signed documents over time, even as technology evolves.

### 2. **Legal Compliance**
   - The preservation service complies with eIDAS standards and ETSI specifications (e.g., ETSI TS 119 511), guaranteeing that preserved signatures remain legally binding.
   - It extends the probative value of qualified electronic signatures beyond their initial technological validity period.

### 3. **Protection Against Tampering**
   - By using advanced encryption, secure storage, and time-stamping, the preservation service protects electronic signatures from tampering or unauthorized modifications.
   - This ensures that preserved signatures maintain their original integrity.

### 4. **Integration with Archiving Systems**
   - While preservation focuses on maintaining the trustworthiness of electronic signatures and seals, it can work alongside electronic archiving systems to provide comprehensive document management solutions.
   - Preservation targets the signature or seal itself, while archiving focuses on the document's integrity.

### 5. **Cross-Border Recognition**
   - Ensures interoperability across EU member states by adhering to eIDAS standards for preservation services.
   - Facilitates seamless digital transactions by maintaining trust in preserved electronic signatures across borders.
