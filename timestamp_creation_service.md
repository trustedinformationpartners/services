## Role and Importance of the Timestamp Creation Service

### 1. **Creation of Qualified Electronic Time Stamps**
   - This service ensures the generation of timestamps that provide proof of the exact date and time when data was created or modified.
   - Qualified electronic time stamps are issued by Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs) and comply with strict eIDAS requirements.

### 2. **Legal Certainty**
   - Provides legal assurance that the timestamp accurately reflects the date and time, ensuring its integrity and authenticity.
   - Qualified timestamps enjoy the presumption of accuracy and legal validity across all EU member states.

### 3. **Data Integrity and Reliability**
   - Ensures that data linked to the timestamp remains intact and unaltered over time.
   - Offers a reliable mechanism to prove the existence of information at a specific moment in the past.

### 4. **Compliance with eIDAS Standards**
   - Operates according to Article 41 of eIDAS, which specifies requirements for qualified electronic time stamps.
   - Uses cryptographic techniques to bind data securely to a specific date and time.
