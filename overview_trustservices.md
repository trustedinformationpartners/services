## Explanation

1. **Qualified vs. Non-Qualified Services**
   - *Qualified services*: Meet stricter legal requirements, offering higher reliability and legal certainty.
   - *Non-qualified services*: Less stringent requirements, but still useful for many applications.

2. **Trust Service Providers (TSPs)**
   - TSPs deliver these services.
   - Qualified TSPs (QTSPs) are certified by an independent auditor.

3. **New Additions in eIDAS 2.0**
   - Additional services such as electronic ledgers and archiving services have been introduced to enable broader use cases.
