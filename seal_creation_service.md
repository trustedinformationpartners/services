## Role and Importance of the Creation of Seal Trust Service

### 1. **Definition and Purpose**
   - The Creation of Seal service enables legal entities to generate electronic seals that confirm the authenticity, integrity, and origin of digital documents.
   - Electronic seals function as the digital equivalent of physical stamps, certifying and protecting the origin of electronic documents or data.

### 2. **Legal Framework and Validity**
   - Regulated under the eIDAS Regulation (910/2014), electronic seals provide a framework for secure, trustworthy electronic transactions across borders.
   - A Qualified Electronic Seal (QESeal) enjoys the presumption of integrity of data and correctness of origin, with recognition across all EU Member States.
   - Unlike electronic signatures which represent "proof of will" for natural persons, electronic seals are specifically designed for legal entities (businesses or organizations).

### 3. **Security Levels and Implementation**
   - Electronic seals can be implemented at different security levels, with Qualified Electronic Seals offering the highest level of assurance.
   - A Qualified Electronic Seal is created using a Qualified Seal Creation Device (QSealCD) and is based on a qualified certificate issued by a Qualified Trust Service Provider (QTSP).
   - The creation process ensures that seals are tamper-proof, providing robust protection against unauthorized alterations.

### 4. **Business Applications and Benefits**
   - Enables full automation of legal document issuance processes, which was previously impossible with electronic signatures that required a natural person to sign.
   - Commonly used for documents with major legal consequences or risks, such as invoices, contracts, and administrative documentation.
   - Particularly valuable in regulated sectors including banking, insurance, healthcare, and public administration.
   - Helps organizations improve operational efficiency, reduce document fraud risk, and enhance trust in electronic transactions.

## Summary

The **Creation of Seal** trust service is a critical component within the **Electronic Seals** category under eIDAS. It provides legal entities with the capability to authenticate and protect their digital documents, ensuring integrity and origin verification. By enabling automation and providing legal recognition across EU borders, this service plays a vital role in facilitating secure digital transactions and supporting organizational digital transformation initiatives.
