## Role and Importance of the Signature Certificate Issuance Service

### 1. **Issuance of Certificates for Electronic Signatures**
   - This service is responsible for generating and issuing digital certificates that are used to create electronic signatures.
   - Qualified certificates are issued by Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs) and comply with strict eIDAS requirements.

### 2. **Legal Validity**
   - The certificates provide proof of identity for the signatory and ensure that electronic signatures are legally binding under eIDAS.
   - Qualified certificates enable the creation of **Qualified Electronic Signatures (QES)**, which have the same legal standing as handwritten signatures.

### 3. **Integration with Remote Signing**
   - The issuance service works seamlessly with remote signature creation devices by providing the necessary certificates for secure signing processes.
   - For example, QTSPs like Entrust offer eIDAS-qualified certificates via their Remote Signing Service, enabling employees to sign documents securely from anywhere[1][5].

### 4. **Compliance with eIDAS Standards**
   - The service ensures that identity verification is performed before issuing a certificate, as required by Annex I of the eIDAS regulation.
   - Certificates must be stored in a Qualified Signature Creation Device (QSCD) to generate QES; otherwise, they are used for advanced signatures.
