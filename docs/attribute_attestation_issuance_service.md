## Role and Importance of the Attribute Attestation Issuance Service

### 1. **Issuance of Electronic Attestations of Attributes**
   - This service is responsible for generating and issuing electronic attestations that verify specific attributes of a natural or legal person. Think of proof of having a diploma, being older than 18 or a profesional role.
   - Qualified attestations are issued by Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs) and comply with strict eIDAS requirements, providing the highest level of assurance.

### 2. **Legal Validity**
   - The attestations provide verifiable proof of specific attributes about a person or entity, ensuring these claims can be trusted by relying parties. 
   - Qualified Electronic Attestations of Attributes (QEAA) enjoy legal recognition across all EU member states, facilitating cross-border recognition of credentials.

### 3. **Integration with Authentic Sources**
   - The service connects with Authentic Sources to verify the accuracy of attributes before issuing attestations.
   - For attributes listed in Annex VI of the eIDAS Regulation (address, age, gender, civil status, family composition, nationality, education qualifications, professional qualifications, permits, financial data), Authentic Sources must provide interfaces to QEAA Providers.

### 4. **Non-repudation**

Non-repudiation in the context of QEAA provides:

- Legal certainty: It guarantees that a party cannot deny having performed a certain action or having sent or received a document

- Evidential value: It provides proof of the origin of data and the integrity of that data, making it extremely difficult to successfully deny who or where a message came from

- Authenticity: It ensures the certainty that a document actually originates from the claimed source and has not been forged or modified

### 5. **Compliance with eIDAS Standards**
   - The service ensures that attestations meet the requirements laid down in Annex V of the eIDAS Regulation.
   - Attestations must be issued in accordance with specified data models (ISO/IEC 18013-5:2021, W3C Verifiable Credentials) and enable selective disclosure of attributes.

   - Enables citizens and businesses to use their credentials across EU member states without the need for additional verification procedures.
   - Creates new markets for service providers looking to expand operations across borders by providing a standardized way to verify user attributes.

### 2. **Industry-Specific Applications**

   - Supports vertical integration of attribute verification into industry-specific workflows and compliance requirements.

### 3. **Integration with Digital Identity Ecosystems**
   - Works seamlessly with European Digital Identity Wallets, allowing users to store and present their verified attributes.
   - Opens new markets at the intersection of identity management and attribute verification, enabling innovative solutions for secure and privacy-preserving identity systems.
